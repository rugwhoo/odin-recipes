    <img src="../images/Gnocchi-pomodoro.jpg" height="400px">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gnocchi with pomodoro sauce is a comforting Italian classic, where pillowy-soft potato dumplings meet a vibrant, slow-cooked tomato sauce. The gnocchi, delicate yet satisfying, soak up the velvety sauce infused with garlic, basil, and a hint of olive oil. Each bite melts in your mouth, bursting with comforting, homely flavors.</p>
    <p>Topped with a generous sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan and a drizzle of aromatic olive oil, the dish is a perfect harmony of simplicity and indulgence. The tangy, sweet pomodoro sauce balances beautifully with the gnocchi's creamy texture, making this dish a true celebration of Italian culinary tradition.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 (12 ounce) packages refrigerated gnocchi</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch sugar</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole Italian plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
        <li>8 ounces marinated mozzarella balls</li>
        <li>fresh parsley or basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open marinated mozzarella balls and measure out 1/4 cup of the oil.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook gnocchi in batches in the hot oil until golden and heated through. Divide gnocchi evenly amongst 4 gratin dishes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and red chili flakes to the oil in the same skillet. Cook until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in salt and sugar. Pour in tomatoes. Use a wooden spoon to break up and crush the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Bring sauce to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer tomatoes for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Taste sauce and adjust seasonings if desired. Spoon tomato sauce over the gnocchi. Top each dish with 3 marinated mozzarella balls and set on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Add baking sheet to oven and broil until mozzarella balls are melted and golden browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley or basil if desired and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Che bontà!</p>
