    <h1>Panzanella Salad</h1>
    <img src="../images/Panzanella.jpg" height="400px">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Panzanella salad is a rustic Italian delight that transforms simple ingredients into a feast of textures and flavors. Juicy, sun-ripened tomatoes, crisp cucumbers, and fragrant basil are tossed with chunks of golden, olive oil-soaked bread. The bread absorbs the tangy vinaigrette, creating a satisfying bite that's hearty yet refreshing.</p>
    <p>Each forkful bursts with vibrant Mediterranean essence, where the sweetness of tomatoes contrasts with the briny depth of capers or olives. The bread's crunch mingles with the fresh vegetables, while a drizzle of olive oil and vinegar ties everything together. Panzanella is summer on a plate—simple, bright, and utterly delicious.</p>
