    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Eggplant Parmesan is a masterpiece of Italian comfort food, layering tender, golden-fried slices of eggplant with rich marinara sauce, gooey mozzarella, and nutty Parmesan cheese. Baked to perfection, the dish emerges bubbling and golden, its aroma a tantalizing blend of garlic, basil, and melted cheese that promises indulgent satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Each forkful is a symphony of textures—the crisp coating of the eggplant, the creamy melted cheese, and the luscious, tangy tomato sauce. The flavors intertwine beautifully, delivering a hearty yet elegant experience. Topped with a sprinkle of fresh herbs, Eggplant Parmesan is a dish that warms the soul with every bite.</p>
